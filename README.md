# MediPlat_Mobile_Application
This is a simple smartphone application that is made with the framework kivy/kivymd and the python programming language.
## The "problem", that becomes an idea for the project.
The company that I used to work has to do with sales of medical products. Every product that the company is selling contains two useful numbers such as REF number and Batch/lot number that characterize a product. So, when an employee of the company was selling a product to a customer, should fill a proper excel file that the company has with the proper informations such as the REF number the description of the product, the batch/lot number and also the quantity. At the same time the excel file should have more informations such as the customer name, the date that the customer took the product and other informations that the company must have in order to create a bill. This was very time-consuming operation and I decided to create a mobile application for every employee of the company.
### This is the proper excel file that every employee should fill.
